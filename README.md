# Wireframing

## 📌 Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating low-fidelity visual guides that represent the skeletal structure of a digital interface, such as a website or mobile app. It outlines the layout, content placement, and overall navigation flow without getting into the detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images.

Wireframes serve as a blueprint for both the designers and developers, helping everyone understand the structure and user experience early in the development lifecycle.

## 🚀 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarifies the Vision**: Wireframes help translate abstract ideas into concrete visual representations, making it easier for teams to align on the project's direction.
- **Saves Time and Resources**: By identifying usability issues early, wireframing helps avoid costly redesigns later in the process.
- **Improves Collaboration**: Provides a communication tool between stakeholders, designers, and developers to gather feedback and refine requirements.
- **Enhances User Experience**: Ensures that the interface is user-friendly by focusing on functionality and navigation before visual aesthetics.
